Modifications to read mol2 file with the CHARMM atom types encoded in the ALT_TYPE field, in such a way we keep the standard sybyl atom types. Up to now this has been implemented only for the write_mol2_clus_pproc, but should be changed for the write_mol2 as well.

Added a check if outputs and scratch folder already exist (in this case does not need to create them again).
16.11.2016
Modifications to seed.inp and seed.par: moved some options from .inp to .par and changed the order.
Do not need to specify any more the options for the receptor desolvation algorithm. The choice of "co" (Coulomb Approximation) is hard-coded and the UHBD exe and dir are set to empty strings. However the variables were not removed to maintain retro-compatibility.

Removed check for SUBSTRUCTURE tag from CheckMol2File() function.

Modified ExtOutNam to deal with one single input file

As conformations are now considered separate fragments they are read directly by ReFrFi_mol2()
instead of ReFrFi_coo_mol2().

In nrutils, function nrerror(), changed the function signature to "char const *"

13.01.2017
Adding new input parameter for the number of poses saved in new output file (equivalent to NuClusMem): NuPosMem. file name: <input .mol2>_poses_pproc.mol2

Introduce new input parameter for printing the summary table: write_sumtab_opt

Added CluIndexSort to find the new cluster numbering from the old one

Added write_best_opt:  option for writing *_best_pproc* files. To be read from seed.par
