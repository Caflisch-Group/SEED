IMPORTANT:
SEED was developed to dock small (< 20 heavy atoms) and mainly rigid fragments.
Thus, SEED fails to correctly dock large kinase inhibitors, e.g., 4gk2 (31 heavy atoms) which is not included in this test case
as ligand, while SEED correctly docks the xanthine scaffold of 4gk2 (17 heavy atoms).
In general, the pose predicted by SEED tends to be less buried than the binding mode in the crystal structure.
This is evident in all ligands of this test case, and particularly for 4pqc.
